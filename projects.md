## HITar

Freedom of expression at your fingertips.

Messy pedalboards. Barely controllable digital sets. Many devices that do one thing, and can do one wrong thing. The life of the modern musician is filled with great technology, controlled with not-so-great interfaces. The HITar demonstrates a revolutionary technology to control loops, percussions, effects, and tech straight from your guitar's body, with the musicality and nuance that you expect from your guitar.
