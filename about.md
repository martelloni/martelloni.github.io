# About

I am an audio software engineer and researcher from the UK, with a PhD in Artificial Intelligence and Music. With over a decade of experience spanning DSP algorithm development, embedded systems, and pioneering work in AI/ML for audio, I am passionate about translating complex signal processing and machine learning concepts into innovative real-world applications for the creative industries and beyond.

My background includes bringing numerous products in professional and consumer electronics to fruition, from active noise-cancelling headphones and video encoders to guitar/bass amplifiers. My recent research in edge AI, including the development of the **MEML** framework for on-device training, has deepened my focus on the potential and challenges of deploying small, efficient AI models for real-time signal manipulation and gesture recognition. The **HITar**, an AI-augmented acoustic guitar and international award winner, exemplifies my commitment to designing responsive, intimate, and cutting-edge musical interactions. I thrive on leveraging deep technical expertise to create impactful and engaging user experiences.
